### Summary
Few monthes ago I became interested in web development and, you know, it fascinated me so much that I decided to change my scope of activity. Therefore, I began to attend online courses, watch tutorials, read books and, finally, programming. In order to gain more experience and get some extra knowledges in web I decided to attend RSS course, cos' I really passion about programming.
I'm highly *responsible*, *motivated* and really *passionate* about my work. I always dive deep into projects and care greatly about the final product.
