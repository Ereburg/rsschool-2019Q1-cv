### Summary
Few monthes ago I began studying web development and decided to change my previous job (and whole life) in order to have more experience in programming and get some extra knowledges in web. 
I'm highly *responsible*, *motivated* and really *passionate* about my work. I always dive deep into projects and care greatly about the final product. 
I have good *planning skills, strong critical thinking and communication skills*. I'm always looking for professional learning opportunities and working on *self-development*. 
Also I'm interested in UX/UI design, human behaviour psychology and modern technologies.
